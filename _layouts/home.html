    I am a PhD Candidate at <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en">King Abdullah University of Science and Technology</a> (KAUST) in <a href="https://smi.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Home.aspx">Seismic Modeling and
    Inversion group</a> run by <a href="http://danielpeter.github.io/index.html">Prof. Daniel Peter</a>. I am broadly interested in numerical methods in geophysics, which includes but not limited to <b>Machine Learning</b>, <b>Seismic Imaging</b>, <b>HPC</b> and <b>Natural Stress State Reconstruction</b>
    <br><br>
    My PhD research is focused on developing ML-based methods to improve seismic inversion.

  <h3>Bio</h3>
  <p>
    I grew up in Moscow and received my M.Sc degree in Physics from <a href="https://www.msu.ru/en/">Lomonosov
      Moscow State University</a> in 2014. During the M.Sc program my research was focused on natural stress-state
    reconstruction. I was working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yu_Rebetsky">Dr. Yu.L.
      Rebetsky</a> in the tectonophysics lab at the <a href="http://www.ifz.ru/en/institute/">Schmidt Institute of
      Physics of the Earth of the Russian Academy of Sciences</a>.</p>

  <p>
    In 2015 I got <a href="http://www.ipgp.fr/fr/international-master-of-research-in-exploration-geophysics-gpx">Master of Research in Exploration Geophysics (GPX)</a> from the <a href="http://www.ipgp.fr/fr">Institut
      de Physique du Globe de Paris</a> (Paris VII) in Paris. There, I worked with <a href="http://www.ipgp.fr/en/fuji-nobuaki">Prof. Nobuaki
      Fuji</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roland_Martin/info">Dr. Roland Martin</a> (CNRS) on
    accurate finite difference operators for synthetic seismogram calculation in areas with sharp lithological
    interfaces.

    Aside research activities I like learning languages, good food, BJJ, playing golf and guitar.

        <p>
          We apply an iterative style transfer approach from image processing to produce realistically textured subsurface models based on synthetic prior models. These realistically textured models to be used in training datasets for machine learning applications in geophysics.

        <p>
        Here, we propose and utilize transfer learning to reduce the computational efforts for optimal architecture search and initial network training. We re-train the light-weight MobileNet convolutional network to infer low-frequency data from a frequency-domain representation of individual shot-gathers, which leads to an efficient, yet accurate inference of low fre- quencies according to wavenumber theory.

          Extrapolation Using a Feed-Forward ANN</a></h3>
      <p>
        We explored the feasibility of frequency-bandwidth extrapolation using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
        approach. The ANN is trained to be a non-linear operator that maps high-frequency data for a single source and
        multiple receivers to low-frequency data.

          of moment tensor inversion from a single borehole data using Artificial Neural Networks</a></h3>
      <p>
          We discuss the feasibility of using artificial neural networks for moment tensor inversion of three-component microseismic data from a single
          vertical well. For this purpose, we solve a nonlinear regression problem using a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN).

      <p>
        We have developed a variance-based method for reconstruction of velocity models to resolve the imaging and
        inversion issues caused by salt bodies. Our main idea lies in retrieving useful information from independent
        updates corresponding to FWI at different frequencies.
