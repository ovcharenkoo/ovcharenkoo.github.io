  My name is Oleg Ovcharenko, a Solutions Architect at NVIDIA.

  My scientific journey began with undergraduate and graduate studies in physics and later I found myself doing my PhD
  research at the intersection of deep learning and exploration geophysics at a computational seismology group.
  <br><br>

  At NVIDIA, I specialize in generative AI and accelerated computing, among other cutting-edge technologies where I got
  my hands dirty.
  These are building industrial digital twins, video-analytics on edge, and GPU-accelerated data analytics.

      <p>
        Acquiring low-frequency data is challenging in practice for active seismic surveys. We propose to jointly reconstruct low-frequency data and a smooth background subsurface model within a multi-task deep learning framework.

          transformations</a></h3>
      <p>
        We proposed a general method for domain adaptation which blends features from source and target datasets by a
        set of linear operations such a cross-correlation and convolution. We explore the viability of the approach by
        transferring knowledge from training on gray-scale MNIST dataset to colored MNIST-M dataset.

        Research project from my internship in CGG, Crawley, UK. Under supervision of Song Hou I explored benefits and
        pitfalls of using GANs for seismic data reconstruction. In the nutsell, high perceptual realism of reconstructed
        seismic data is not sufficient for real-world application. Physics also should be constrained.

        <p>
        Here, we propose and utilize transfer learning to reduce the computational efforts for optimal architecture search and initial network training. We re-train the light-weight MobileNet convolutional network to infer low-frequency data from a frequency-domain representation of individual shot-gathers, which leads to an efficient, yet accurate inference of low fre- quencies according to wavenumber theory.

      <p>
        We explored the feasibility of frequency-bandwidth extrapolation using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
        approach. The ANN is trained to be a non-linear operator that maps high-frequency data for a single source and
        multiple receivers to low-frequency data.

          We discuss the feasibility of using artificial neural networks for moment tensor inversion of three-component microseismic data from a single

        We have developed a variance-based method for reconstruction of velocity models to resolve the imaging and
