    I am a PhD Candidate with entrepreneural mindset at <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en">King Abdullah University
      of Science and Technology</a> (KAUST) in <a href="https://smi.kaust.edu.sa/Pages/Home.aspx">Seismic Modeling and
      Inversion group</a> run by <a href="http://danielpeter.github.io/index.html">Prof. Daniel Peter</a>. I am broadly
    interested in <b>numerical methods in global and exploration geophysics</b>, which includes but not limited to:
    <ul>
      <li> Seismic Imaging </li>
      <li> Machine Learning </li>
      <li> Natural stress state reconstruction </li>
      <li> HPC </li>

  <h3>Bio</h3>
  <p>
    I grew up in Moscow and received my M.Sc degree in Physics from <a href="https://www.msu.ru/en/">Lomonosov
      Moscow State University</a> in 2014. During the M.Sc program my research was focused on natural stress-state
    reconstruction. I was working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yu_Rebetsky">Dr. Yu.L.
      Rebetsky</a> in the tectonophysics lab at the <a href="http://www.ifz.ru/en/institute/">Schmidt Institute of
      Physics of the Earth of the Russian Academy of Sciences</a>.</p>

  <p>
    In 2015 I got <a href="http://www.ipgp.fr/fr/international-master-of-research-in-exploration-geophysics-gpx">Master of Research in Exploration Geophysics (GPX)</a> from the <a href="http://www.ipgp.fr/fr">Institut
      de Physique du Globe de Paris</a> (Paris VII) in Paris. There, I worked with <a href="http://www.ipgp.fr/en/fuji-nobuaki">Prof. Nobuaki
      Fuji</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roland_Martin/info">Dr. Roland Martin</a> (CNRS) on
    accurate finite difference operators for synthetic seismogram calculation in areas with sharp lithological
    interfaces.

          Extrapolation Using a Feed-Forward ANN</a></h3>
      <p>
        We explored the feasibility of frequency-bandwidth extrapolation using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
        approach. The ANN is trained to be a non-linear operator that maps high-frequency data for a single source and
        multiple receivers to low-frequency data.

          of moment tensor inversion from a single borehole data using Artificial Neural Networks</a></h3>
      <p>
          We discuss the feasibility of using artificial neural networks for moment tensor inversion of three-component microseismic data from a single
          vertical well. For this purpose, we solve a nonlinear regression problem using a feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN).

          FWI</a></h3>
      <p>
        We have developed a variance-based method for reconstruction of velocity models to resolve the imaging and
        inversion issues caused by salt bodies. Our main idea lies in retrieving useful information from independent
        updates corresponding to FWI at different frequencies.
