  <p>
    I grew up in Moscow and received my M.Sc degree in Physics from <a href="https://www.msu.ru/en/">Lomonosov
      Moscow State University</a> in 2014. During the M.Sc program my research was focused on natural stress-state
    reconstruction. I was working under the supervision of <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yu_Rebetsky">Dr. Yu.L.
      Rebetsky</a> in the tectonophysics lab at the <a href="http://www.ifz.ru/en/institute/">Schmidt Institute of
      Physics of the Earth of the Russian Academy of Sciences</a>.</p>

  <p>
    In 2015 I got <a href="http://www.ipgp.fr/fr/international-master-of-research-in-exploration-geophysics-gpx">Master of Research in Exploration Geophysics (GPX)</a> from the <a href="http://www.ipgp.fr/fr">Institut
      de Physique du Globe de Paris</a> (Paris VII) in Paris. There, I worked with <a href="http://www.ipgp.fr/en/fuji-nobuaki">Prof. Nobuaki
      Fuji</a> and <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roland_Martin/info">Dr. Roland Martin</a> (CNRS) on
    accurate finite difference operators for synthetic seismogram calculation in areas with sharp lithological
    interfaces.

  In 2021 I graduated with Ph.D. degree from <a href="https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en">KAUST</a> in Saudi Arabia. There I was mentored by Prof. Daniel Peter and Prof. Tariq Alkhalifah, exploring the capability of deep learning to initialize seismic full-waveform inversion.
